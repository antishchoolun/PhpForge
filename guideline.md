Security and Best Practices
Input Validation:
Validate all inputs on both frontend and backend (Laravel) to prevent injection attacks.
API Security:
Store Groq API keys in environment variables (.env).
Use HTTPS for all communications.
Code Quality:
Use ESLint for React and PHP_CodeSniffer for PHP to enforce coding standards.
Break long code into smaller functions or methods for readability and maintainability.
